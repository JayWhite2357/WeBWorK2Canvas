# WeBWorK2Canvas

There are two parts to this. You could either copy [this code](https://github.com/JayWhite2357/WeBWorK2Canvas), and run it locally, or just view it on github pages.
The first part takes a WeBWorK archive of assignment sets and then creates matching assigments in Canvas. It can be accessed [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/WeBWorK2Canvas/ImportAssignments).
The second part takes a WeBWorK grade totals csv and converts it into a csv importable into the Canvas gradebook. It can be accessed [here](https://jaywhite2357.github.io/WeBWorK2Canvas/ConvertGrades).

**The API of Canvas may change, and the format of files may change, so this may not last forever.**

If anyone wants to make the UI (or anything else for that matter) better, feel free to create a pull request: I will gladly pull improvements.
